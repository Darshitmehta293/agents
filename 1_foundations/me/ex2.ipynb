       "The correct answer is **c) that there is no necessary connection between thoughts and their objects, making all metaphysical statements arbitrary?**\n",
       "\n",
       "Here's why:\n",
       "\n",
       "1.  **Hume's Critique of Metaphysics:** David Hume was a radical empiricist who argued that all knowledge derives from experience (impressions and ideas). He famously critiqued the idea of **necessary connection**, particularly in causality. He observed that we only perceive \"constant conjunction\" between events, not an inherent, logical, or metaphysical link that *must* exist. Because traditional metaphysics often made claims about ultimate causes, substances, or *a priori* truths that went beyond what experience could verify or establish with necessary connections, Hume deemed such statements to be arbitrary, unfounded, and ultimately meaningless \"sophistry and illusion.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "2.  **Analyzing Option (c):** This option directly echoes Hume's central point about the lack of **necessary connection**. If there's no necessary link between our thoughts/concepts and the actual objects or states of affairs in the world (beyond what experience can confirm), then any metaphysical statement that claims such a necessary, underlying truth or connection *beyond experience* becomes arbitrary. This is entirely consistent with Hume's project to dismantle traditional metaphysics.\n",
       "\n",
       "3.  **Why the other options don't fit:**\n",
       "    *   **a) that \"isLAND\" refers meaningfully only within an objective social contract:** This aligns more with Searle's work on **social reality** and **institutional facts** (e.g., money, government, property). While Hume recognized the role of convention in society, his critique of metaphysics wasn't primarily about the social construction of meaning for specific terms, but rather the unjustified claims about mind-independent reality or necessary truths.\n",
       "    *   **b) that meaning arises solely from disuse and non-replacement in language:** This doesn't sound like a prominent Searle position and has no direct relevance to Hume's critique of metaphysics, which focused on epistemology and the limits of knowledge, not linguistic evolution."
